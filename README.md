# Multiple-Games-JS-Test
A test to see if I could store the code of multiple games into a single JS file.  This time, all the code is stored in a single JS Object again.  I intended to create three games, but after I finished the second one, I was too lazy to create the third one.  Go to the gh-pages version to enjoy the game online.
